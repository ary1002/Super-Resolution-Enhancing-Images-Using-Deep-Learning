# Super-Resolution-Enhancing-Images-Using-Deep-Learning
The task at hand is to equip mentees with fundamental knowledge in deep learning, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and generative adversarial networks (GANs). Subsequently, guide them through the complex landscape of Super Resolution, culminating in the implementation of cutting-edge Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Networks (SRGANs) such as ESRGAN.
