# Super-Resolution-Enhancing-Images-Using-Deep-Learning
The task at hand is to equip mentees with fundamental knowledge in deep learning, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and generative adversarial networks (GANs). Subsequently, guide them through the complex landscape of Super Resolution, culminating in the implementation of cutting-edge Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Networks (SRGANs) such as ESRGAN.
## TENTATIVE TIMELINE : 
1. Week 1: Deep Learning Fundamentals
Understand the theoretical underpinnings of neural networks, including forward and backward passes, optimization, and regularization.
Acquire practical skills in implementing basic neural networks.
2. Week 2 : Introduction to CNNs and GANs 
Master the principles of Convolutional Neural Networks and their applications.
Gain a deep understanding of Generative Adversarial Networks, their variations, and the ability to implement them in PyTorch.
3. Week 3 : Introduction to Super Resolution and State-Of-The-Art Models
Develop an appreciation for the intricacies of Super Resolution, its significance, and explore seminal research papers in the field.
Identify and preprocess suitable datasets for SR experiments.
4. Week 4 : Hands On Implementation and Testing
Implement state-of-the-art Super Resolution models, such as ESRGAN or SRGAN.
Evaluate the performance of these models, employing appropriate metrics and fine-tuning techniques.
Present their findings and demonstrate their super resolution models on chosen datasets.
The mentees will emerge from this intensive 4-week journey with the technical prowess to tackle complex AI challenges, particularly in the domain of Super Resolution, and will have acquired valuable skills that will pave the way for their future endeavors in AI and machine learning.
## DATASET :
Training : Weâ€™ll primarily use the DIV2K dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joe1995/div2k-dataset) for training and validation. More datasets may be used to further improve our model.
Testing : Set5 and Set14 datasets (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ll01dm/set-5-14-super-resolution-dataset)
